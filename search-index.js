my name is Trelston Moraes and welcome to my personal documentation website. It is more like a personal knowledge management website. At this point of time, it is still a work in progress with 5 important sections that I have detailed below: I have 15 years of experience in developing and deploying small, medium and large enterprise applications using the dotnet platorm. The aim of this section is for me to answer the question - \"If I were to start a new project today. How will I proceed?\". I would like to answer this question not only with a sample project but also a sample end to end process - from development to deployment - that the team will follow. For this, I am going to use the Microsoft Engineering Playbook. While this playbook, is abstract and conceptual, my intention is to make it more concrete with scenarios and walkthroughs. My idea is that a new developer joining the team will execute these walkthroughs and will therefore understand the process, the architecture and the code of my project. In this section, I intend to go through all the architecture styles documented in Azure Architecture Styles and have a terraform file created for each architecture style for easy deployment to Azure. In this section, you will find all the notes I take while studying a particular topic or blog posts. I randomly study different topics at different times and I want to document what I study and also make it easily searchable. Now, I normally use Obsidian as a personal note taking application and pinboard to bookmark all the blog posts, this is just another layer in that system. This is the product section. These are the free products, I am working on.

This approach is useful for chaining together a series of \"or else\" expressions where the first success \"wins\" and becomes the overall result. If the workflow has the concept of sequential steps, then the overall result is just the value of the last step, and all the previous steps are evaluated only for their side effects. In normal F#, this would be written: do some expression do some other expression final expression In normal F#, each expression (other than the last) evaluates to the unit value. The equivalent approach for computation expression is to treat each expression (other than the last) as a wrapped unit value, and \"pass it into\" the next expression, and so on, until you reach the last expression. module TraceBuilder1 = type TraceBuilder1 () = member this.Bind(x,f) = match x with | None -> printfn \"Binding with None.

And the Zero method should create an empty data structure, if needed. We have looked at different implementations for Combine for option types. - The first one used options as \"success/failure\" indicators, when the first success \"won\".

Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type. This wrapper type is used in both Bind and Return, which leads to a key benefit: the output of a Return can be fed to the input of a Bind In other words, because a workflow returns a wrapper type, and because let! consumes a wrapper type, you can put a “child” workflow on the right hand side of a let! expression. let subworkflow0 = myworkflow { return 42 } let subworkflow1 = myworkflow { return 43 } let aWrappedValue = myworkflow { let! unwrappedValue1 = subworkflow1 let! unwrappedValue2 = subworkflow2 return unwrappedValue1 + unwrappedValue2 } let aWrappedValue = myworkflow { let! unwrappedValue1 = myworkflow { let! x = myworkflow { return 1 } return x } let! unwrappedValue2 = myworkflow { let! y = myworkflow { return 2 } return y } return unwrappedValue1 + unwrappedValue2 } Sometimes we have a function that already returns a wrapped value, and we want to return it directly. return is no good for this, because it requires an unwrapped type as input. The solution is a variant on return called return!, which takes a wrapped type as input and returns it. The corresponding method in the “builder” class is called ReturnFrom.

We want to use the “return” keyword to return early and stop any more processing being done. return and yield do not generate an early return from a computation expression.

This is a problem, because you might get unwanted side effects and your code is doing something unnecessary, which might cause performance problems. Use the delay method to do this. Any result from Return or Yield is immediately wrapped in a “delay” function like this, and then you can choose whether to run it or not. module TraceBuilder = type TraceBuilder() = member this.Bind(m, f) = match m with | None -> printfn \"Binding with None.

But what about the logging example in the previous post? There was no wrapper type there. There was a let! that did things behind the scenes, but the input type was the same as the output type. The type was left unchanged. The short answer to this is that you can treat any type as its own “wrapper”. If you have a type such as List, it is in fact not a “real” type at all. List is a real type, and List is a real type. But List on its own is incomplete. One way to think about List is that it is a function, not a type. And like any function it takes a parameter, in this case a “type parameter”. Which is why the concept that .NET developers call “generics” is known as “parametric polymorphism” in computer science terminology. Once we grasp the concept of functions that generate one type from another type (called “type constructors”), we can see that what we really mean by a “wrapper type” is just a type constructor. But if a “wrapper type” is just a function that maps one type to another type, surely a function that maps a type to the same type fits into this category? And indeed it does. The “identity” function for types fits our definition and can be used as a wrapper type for computation expressions. We can define the “identity workflow” as the simplest possible implementation of a workflow builder. type IdentityBuilder() = member this.Bind(x,f) = f x member this.Return(x) = x member this.ReturnFrom(x) = x let identity = new IdentityBuilder() let result = identity { let! x = 1 let! y = 2 return x + y } With this in place, you can see that the logging example discussed earlier is just the identity workflow with some logging added in. A major use of computation expressions is to unwrap and rewrap values that are stored in some sort of wrapper type. You can easily compose computation expressions, because the output of a Return can be fed to the input of a Bind. Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type. Any type with a generic parameter can be used as a wrapper type, even lists. When creating workflows, you should ensure that your implementation conforms to the three sensible rules about wrapping and unwrapping and composition.","title":"Identity Wrapper Types","component":"studynotes","version":"0.1","name":"IdentityWrapperTypes","url":"/studynotes/0.1/FSharp/IdentityWrapperTypes.html","titles":[]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"The let! expression is syntactic sugar for a Bind method.

We’ve used four different approaches for the “safe divide” example so far. Let’s put them together side by side and compare them once more.

Here is the most explicit way of doing it. As you can see, we have to have pattern matching at each step. let product = let r1 = getCustomerId \"Alice\" match r1 with | Error _ -> r1 | Success custId -> let r2 = getLastOrderForCustomer custId match r2 with | Error _ -> r2 | Success orderId -> let r3 = getLastProductForOrder orderId match r3 with | Error _ -> r3 | Success productId -> printfn \"Product is %s\" productId r3 Really ugly code. And the top-level flow has been submerged in the error handling logic. Computation expressions to the rescue! We can write one that handles the branching of Success/Error behind the scenes: type DbResultBuilder() = member this.Bind(x,f) = match x with | Error _ -> x | Success y -> printfn \"\\tSuccessful: %s\" y f y member this.Return(x) = Success x let dbResult = new DbResultBuilder(); And with this workflow, we can focus on the big picture and write much cleaner code: let product' = dbResult { let! custId = getCustomerId \"Alice\" let! orderId = getLastOrderForCustomer custId let! productId = getLastProductForOrder orderId printfn \"Product is %s\" productId return productId } printfn \"%A\" product And if there are errors, the workflow traps them nicely and tells us where the error was: let product'' = dbResult { let! custId = getCustomerId \"Alice\" let! orderId = getLastOrderForCustomer \"\" //error let! productId = getLastProductForOrder orderId printfn \"Product is %s\" productId return productId } printfn \"%A\" product Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type.

If I learn something new in git, I intend to put it here. A git repository is one giant graph. At the surface level, a git commit consists of 2 things:- a pointer to the state of your code at some moment in time. zero or more pointers to \"parent\" commits A Git commit is a node in a graph, and each one points to the node that came before them. Figure 1. Source: think-like-a-git.net, Git commits (simplified view) To list all commits in your repository: git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all Figure 2. Source: think-like-a-git.net To list all commits in your repository but with a graph view: git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph Figure 3. Source: think-like-a-git.net If you want to see branch and tag labels, add --decorate: git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color You can setup a git alias to do the same thing: git config --global alias.graph \"log --graph --oneline –decorate=short\" GitX shows the logs as follows:- Figure 4. Source: think-like-a-git.net The very colourful labels are called references. References are pointers to commits. There are three types of references: local branch, remote branch, and tag. A local branch reference is a file that contains a 40-byte identifier of the commit that the reference points to. This file is created at the project’s .git/refs/head directory. Creating a branch in Git just means writing 40 bytes to disk, which is why git branch foo` is so fast. Local branch references are specific to a single local repository. Commands that affect local branch references include commit, merge, rebase, and reset. Remote branch references are also specific to a single repository, but one that’s previously been defined as a remote. Commands that affect remote branch references include fetch and push. Tag references are branch references that never move. Once you’ve created a tag, it will never change This behavior makes them useful for marking specific versions of a software package, or marking exactly what got deployed to a production server on a particular date. Only one command affects the tag and i.e git tag Now look at the display:- Figure 5. Source: think-like-a-git.net However, you don’t see commits here. Every git tool hides commits. Imagine this scenario: you write some code and check it in. Then, you realize you forgot to run the tests, so you run them, and they uncover a syntax error. Or you spot a typo. For whatever reason, you weren’t done when you thought you were done. Git gives you an option to tack the new change on to the previous commit using: git commit --amend. This keeps all your related changes bundled together in one commit. A git commit is a SHA-1 hash of the contents of the commit, and the IDs of its parent commits. Which means that, when you use git commit --amend, you’re actually building a completely different commit, and pointing your local branch reference to it instead. The first commit you made is still there on disk, and you can still get back to it Git will decide that it’s time to run garbage collection. You can trigger this process yourself, using git gc. Starting from every branch and every tag, Git walks back through the graph, building a list of every commit it can reach. Once it’s reached the end of every path, it deletes all the commits it didn’t visit. The Secret Of Git can fit it into these four words: References make commits reachable. References …​ whether they are local branches, remote branches, or tags …​ Make commits …​ which are nodes in a graph …​ Reachable …​ so that you can get back to them, and so that Git will not delete them when it decides it is time for spring cleaning. Because references make commits reachable, creating a branch is a way to \"nail down\" part of the graph that you might want to come back to later. Neither git merge nor git rebase will change your existing commits (remember, a commit’s ID is a hash of its contents *and its history*), you can create a temporary branch any time you want to try something you’re even just a little bit unsure about. Creating a branch before you try a merge or a rebase is like saving your game before you battle the boss. Use this pattern if you are unsure or unclear on exactly what git merge does. Being lazy and since it very well explained here without any fluff. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/testing-out-merges/the-scout-pattern.html Being lazy and since it very well explained here without any fluff. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/testing-out-merges/the-savepoint-pattern.html Being lazy and since it very well explained here without any fluff. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/testing-out-merges/black-belt-merging.html Before you start using rebase in a shared repository, make sure everyone who works on your project is comfortable working with rebase. You might also consider changing everyone’s default pull strategy to \"rebase\" instead of \"merge\" What git cherry-pick does is take a commit from somewhere else, and \"play it back\" wherever you are right now. Because this introduces the same change with a different parent, Git builds a new commit with a different ID. Figure 6. Source: think-like-a-git.net If you were at node H in this graph, and you typed git cherry-pick E, you get a copy of commit E, let’s call it E', that pointed to H as its parent. Figure 7. Source: think-like-a-git.net Or if you typed something like git cherry-pick C D E, you get the following: Figure 8. Source: think-like-a-git.net The important thing to notice here is that Git has copied changes made in one place, and replayed them somewhere else. Again being lazy and since it is very well explained here. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/rebase-from-the-ground-up/using-git-cherry-pick-to-simulate-git-rebase.html To summarize the previous section, this: git checkout foo git checkout -b newbar git cherry-pick C D E git checkout bar git reset --hard newbar git branch -d newbar is equivalent to this: git rebase foo bar When you do a rebase, you are rewriting history. You are, in effect, saying to Git, \"Hey, you know those things that happened over there on that completely different timeline? I want you to pretend that they happened here instead.\" Here’s how I think of it: in English, we read from left to right. On most charts that show the change in something over time, time is shown on the x-axis of the graph, with time increasing from left to right. When you issue commands to the shell, you can put several of them on one line, and they’ll be executed in order from left to right. So when I use git rebase, I (almost) always give it two arguments: the name of the place I want to start from, and the name of the place I want to end up. Or, to put it another way, I tell rebase the sequence of events I want it to create, from left to right: git rebase first_this then_this There may be a time when you would like to change the origin url of your git repository to point to another url. You can use the following sequence of commands to do that: git remote rename origin upstream (1) git remote add origin https://github.com//simple-feed-reader/ (2) git push -u origin main (3) 1 Rename the existing origin remote to upstream 2 Add a new origin remote pointing to your copy of the repository on GitHub. 3 Publish your local Git repository to the newly created GitHub repository. commit guidelines Make small commits and commit often. Commit complete and well tested code. Don’t mix whitespace changes with functional code changes. Write good commit messages. commit message guidelines Why is it necessary? (Fix a bug, increase performance, add a feature) How does it address the issue? For short and obvious changes, this can be omitted. What effects does this change have? (may include benchmarks, side effects etc) What limitations does the current code have? (not necessary, but helps if you can think about it) commit message considerations Don’t assume that the code is self-evident/self-documenting. Finding it difficult to summarize your commit? Maybe it includes more than one bug fix or logical change. Consider splitting the commits using git add -p It should be possible to review a change request without reading the contents of the bug or task. Don’t assume the reviwer understands the problem. commit message structure Separate subject from body with a blank line Limit the subject line to 50 characters Capitalize the subject line Do not end the subject line with period Use the imperative mood in the subject line (Fix typo in log vs. Fixed typo in log or Misc fixes in log code) Wrap the body at 72 characters Use the body to explain what and why vs. how Reference fixed issues with closing keywords Example 1. commit message sample Add code review recipe for Go Helps teams automate linting and build verification for go projects. Also gives a list of items to verify for go code reviews.

Routing makes the decision on what data should go to which target and when. Targets include storage, analysis processes and action. Analysis is used to run the data records through a set of conditions and can produce different output data records. Data records are stored and available for display and may trigger actions such as sending email, sms etc. Scenario 1 Device sends data to IoT Hub. IoT hub temporarily stores data. This data is immediately displayed as a graph on-screen. Figure 3. Source: Microsoft Learn Scenario 2 Device sends data to IoT Hub. IoT hub temporarily stores data.

They are deployed in scenarios where data needs to be collected, delivered, and analyzed in real-time, or periodically. These devices connect to a field gateway (IoT Edge device). These devices can use protocols like CoAP5, OPC or technologies like Bluetooth, ZigBee to connect to an edge device. A sensor is a circuit (or device) that collects a specific type of data about the physical environment. A smart sensor is a device that gathers the input and then processes that information locally before forwarding the data. A field gateway is a specialized device-appliance or a general-purpose software that: acts as a communication enabler. may act as a local device control system. can perform local processing. can control functions that are directed back towards the child devices that are connected to it. can be used to filter or aggregate device telemetry. may help with device provisioning, buffering of data, protocol translation, and event processing rules. Application platform as a service (aPaas) provides a cloud environment to build, manage, and deliver applications to customers. Azure IoT Central is a fully managed, end-to-end ready made environment for IoT solution development. It delivers built-in disaster recovery, multitenancy, global availability, and a predictable cost structure. You can tailor Azure hardware and software tools to a specific task or job function. You are responsible for scaling and configuration. The underlying infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is taken care for you. Develop your IoT devices using one of the Azure IoT starter kits or choose a device to use from the Azure Certified for IoT device catalog. SDKs are available for multiple programming languages. IoT Plug and Play can simplify how you create embedded code for your devices. Azure IoT Edge enables offloading parts of your workload from the cloud to the devices. Azure Sphere is a secured, high-level app platform with built-in communication and security features for internet connected devices. It includes a secured microcontroller unit, a custom linux-based operating system, and a cloud based security service which provides continuous, renewable security.

IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. Per-device authentication enables each device to connect securely to IoT hub and be managed securely by IoT hub. You can control user device access and per-device level connection. IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service automatically provisions devices to the correct IoT Hub when the device first boots up. Multiple authentication types: SAS token-based authentication. Individual X.509 certificate authentication for secure, standards-based authentication. X.509 CA authentication for simple, standards-based enrollment. IoT Hub has built-in routing and can setup automatic, rules-based message fan-out: Use message routing to control where your hub sends device telemetry. Can route messages to multiple endpoints at no extra cost. No-code routing rules instead of writing custom message dispatcher code. IoT Hub can integrate with other services:- Azure Event Grid to help your business to quickly react to critical events. Azure Logic Apps to automate business processes. Azure Machine Learning to add machine learning and AI models. Azure Stream Analytics to run real-time analytic computations on the data. IoT Hub can manage your devices:- Store, synchronize, and query device metadata and state information for all your devices. Set device state either per-device or based on some common characteristic. Automatically respond to a device-reported state change. Use Azure IoT device SDK libraries to build applications that run on your devices and interact with IoT Hub. There is a limit of 50 IoT hubs per subscription. You can request quota increases by contacting support. Provisioning is a two part process: The first part is establishing the initial connection between the device and the IoT solution by registering the device. The second part is applying the proper configuration to the device based on the requirements of the solution it was registered to. Secure attestation support for both X.509 and TPM-based identities Multiple allocation policies to control how the DPS assigns devices to IoT hubs. Monitoring and diagnostic logging Mult-hub support allows DPS to assign devices to more than one IoT hub across subscriptions. Cross-region support to assign devices in other regions. Zero-touch provisioning to an IoT solution without hardcoding IoT Hub connection. Load-balancing devices across multiple hubs. Connecting devices to a particular IoT solution depending on use case. Connecting a device to the IoT hub with the lowest latency. Reprovisioning based on a change in the device. Rolling the keys used by the device to connect to IoT Hub. To evaluate which IoT Hub tier is right for you solution, consider the following two questions: What features do I plan to use? How much data do I plan to move daily? This tier enables features for solutions that only need uni-directional communication from devices to the cloud. If your IoT solution is based around collecting data from devices and analyzing it centrally, then the basic tier is probably right for you. This tier of IoT Hubs enables features for solutions that want to make use of the bi-directional communication capabilities. If you would like to control IoT devices remotely or distribute some of your workloads onto the devices themselves, then you should consider the standard tier. Message traffic is measured for your IoT hub on a per-unit basis. When you create an IoT hub, you choose its tier and edition, and set the number of units available. You can purchase up to 200 units for the B1, B2, S1, or S2 edition, or up to 10 units for the B3 or S3 edition. Tier edition Sustained throughput Sustained send rate B1, S1 Up to 1111 KB/minute per unit (1.5 GB/day/unit) Average of 278 messages/minute per unit (400,000 messages/day per unit) B2, S2 Up to 16 MB/minute per unit (22.8 GB/day/unit) Average of 4,167 messages/minute per unit (6 million messages/day per unit) B3, S3 Up to 814 MB/minute per unit (1144.4 GB/day/unit) Average of 208,333 messages/minute per unit (300 million messages/day per unit) Partions can be used to reduce contentions that could occur when concurrently reading and writing to event streams. The partition limit is chosen when IoT hub is created. The maximum partition limit is 32 but most IoT hubs only need 4 partitions. The number of partitions is directly related to the number of concurrent readers you expect to have. The default value of four partitions should be used unless specified by the architect. An endpoint is a service that can retrieve data from other services. Examples of endpoint types: Device-facing endpoints that enables devices to perform operations such as sending device-to-cloud messages and receiving cloud-to-device messages. Service-facing management endpoints that enable back-end apps to perform operations such as device identity management and device twin management. Service facing built-in endpoints for reading device-to-cloud messages. Custom endpoints to receive device-to-cloud messages dispatched by a routing rule. Figure 9.

Service endpoints. Exposes a set of endpoints for your solution back end to communicate with your devices. With one exception, these endpoints are only exposed using the AMQP protocols. The method invocation endpoint is exposed over the Https protocol. Receive device-to-cloud messages. Send cloud-to-device messages and receive delivery acknowledgements. Receive file notifications. Direct method invocation. Receive operation monitoring events. These endpoints act as service endpoints and are used as sinks for message routes. Devices cannot write directly to these custom endpoints. The following services are supported as custom endpoints. Azure Storage containers Event Hubs Service Bus Queues Service Bus Topics There are three different ways for controlling access to IoT Hub: Azure AD - It provides identity-based authentication and fine-grained authorization with Azure RBAC. It supports only IoT hub service api’s. SAS - It lets you group permissions and grant them to applications using access keys and signed security tokens. Per-device security credentials - Each IoT Hub contains an identity registry. For each device in this registry, you can configure security credentials that grant DeviceConnect permissions scoped to the device’s endpoints. Use shared access policies for IoT hub-level access. Use the individual device credentials to scope access to that device only. Azure IoT hub grants access to endpoints by verifying a token against the shared access policies and identity registry security credentials. IoT Hub uses security tokens to authenticate devices and services to avoid sending keys on the wire. Security tokens are limited in time validity and scope. Some scenarios do require you to use security tokens directly. Example: The direct use of the MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS surfaces. The implementation of the token service pattern. IoT hub also allows devices to authenticate with IoT Hub using X.509 certificates. You can verify using X.509 certificates by uploading either a certificate thumbprint or a certificate authority (CA) to Azure IoT Hub. Authentication using certificate thumbprints only verifies that the presented thumbprint matches the configured thumbprint. Authentication using certificate authority validates the certificate chain. Supported Certificates include: An existing X.509 certificate. A device may already have a certificate that it can then use to authenticate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication. CA-signed X.509 certificate. You can use a Certificate Authority signed certificate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication. A self generated and self-signed X.509 certificate. A device manufacturer or in-house deployer can generate these certificates and store the corresponding private key (and certificate) on the device. You can use tools such as OpenSSL and Windows SelfSignedCertificate utility for this purpose. Only works with thumbprint authentication. A device may either use an X.509 certificate or a security token for authentication, but not both. For Azure IoT, there are five stages within the device lifecycle: Plan: Enable operators to create a device metadata scheme that enables them to query for, and target a group of devices for bulk management operations. You can use the device twin to store this device metadata in the form of tags and properties. Provision: Securely provision new devices to IoT Hub and enable operators to immediately discover device capabilities. Configure: Facilitate bulk configuration changes and firmware updates to devices while maintaining both health and security. Monitor: Monitor overall device collection health, the status of ongoing operations, and alert operators to issues that might require attention. Retire: Replace or decommission devices after a failure, upgrade cycle, or at the end of the service lifetime. A device must have an entry in the IoT Hub identity registry before it can connect to an IoT Hub. The deviceID is case-sensitive. The identity registry is a REST-capable collection of device identity resources. IoT Hub creates a set of resources for every device in the identity registry such as the queue that contains in-flight cloud-to-device messages. Use the identity registry when you need to: Provision devices that connect to your IoT hub. Control per-device access to your hub’s device-facing endpoints. You can create module identities under a device identity. Each module identity can be configured with an independent connection to IoT hub. You can seperate access control permissions. You can create up to 20 module identites under a device identity. Identity registry exposes the following operations: Create device or module identity Update device or module identity Retreive device or module identity Delete device or module identity List up to 1000 identities Export device identities to Azure blob storage Import device identities from Azure blob storage You need to specify the Device ID and the authentication type when creating a new device. Device Twins are json documents managed by IoT Hub that store device state information associated with a physical device. This information includes metadata, configurations, and conditions. Azure IoT Hub maintains a device twin for each registered device. Device twins are implicity created and deleted when a device identity is created or deleted in IoT Hub. A device twin is a JSON document that includes: Tags. A solution back end can read from and write to. Tags are not visible to device apps. Desired properties. The solution back end can set desired properties, and the device app can read them. The device app can also receive notifications of changes in the desired properties. Reported properties. The device app can set reported properties, and the solution back end can read and query them. Device identity properties. The read-only properties from the corresponding device identity stored in the identity registry Figure 10.

For example, the deployment location of a vending machine. Report current state information such as available capabilities and conditions from your device app. For example, a device is connected to your IoT hub over cellular or WiFi. Synchronize the state of long-running workflows between device app and back-end app. For example, when the solution back end specifies the new firmware version to install, and the device app reports the various stages of the update process. Query your device metadata, configuration, or state. Each module identity implicitly generates a module twin. Module twins are JSON documents that store module information including metadata, configurations, and conditions. SDKs enable you to create modules where each one opens an independent connection to IoT Hub. For example, if your vending machine has 3 different sensors controlled by different departments in your company, you can create a module for each sensor. This way, each department is only able to create jobs or direct methods for the sensor that they control, avoiding conflicts and user errors. Device monitoring is used to track the overall device collection health, the status of ongoing operations, and to alert operators to issues that might require their attention. Device twin desired and reported properties can be used to monitor a target condition, target content, or device metrics. The Target condition defines the scope of device twins to be updated. It is specified as a query on twin tags and/or reported properties. The Target content defines the desired properties to be added or updated in the targeted device twins. The content includes a path to the section of desired properties to be changed. The Metrics define the summary counts of various configuration states such as Success, In Progress, and Error. Use the IoT Hub identity registry for securely revoking device identities and credentials. You can disable devices by updating the status property of an identity in the identity registry. The disable feature is not available for modules. Protocol When you should use this protocol. MQTT MQTT over WebSocket Use with devices that have their own per-device credentials. AMQP AMQP over websocket Use on field gateways and cloud gateways to take advantage of connection multiplexing across devices. HTTPS Use for devices that support other protocols. Protocol Port MQTT 8883 MQTT over WebSockets 443 AMQP 5671 AMQP over WebSockets 443 HTTPS 443 There are two phases in the provisioning/deployment process for a device:- The manufacturing phase in which the device is created and prepared at the factory. The cloud setup phase in which the Device Provisioning Service is configured for automated provisioning. In this phase, the device is programmed with the provisioning service information, This enables it to call the provisioning service to get its connection info/IoT solution assignment when it is switched on. Also, in this phase, the manufacturer supplies the device deployer/operator with the identifying key information for the device. This identifying information could be an X.509 certificate or the public portion of a trusted platform module. These services are offered by many silicon manufacturers today. This phase is about configuring the cloud for proper automatic provisioning. There are two types of users involved A device operator - someone who knows how devices are intially set up. A solution operator - someonw who knows how devices are to be split among the IoT hubs. A one-time initial setup of the provisioning service must occur. It is done by the solution operator. The device operator then needs to enroll the device. The device operator takes the key identifying information from the manufacturer and adds it to the enrollment list. The Device Provisioning Service can only provision devices to IoT hubs that have been linked to it. Linking an IoT hub to an instance of the DPS gives the service read/write permissions to the IoT hub’s device registry with the link. A DPS can register a device ID and set the initial configuration in the device twin. Linked IoT hubs may be in any Azure region. You may link hubs in other subscriptions to your provisioning service. The service level setting that determines how DPS assigns devices to an IoT hub. There are there supported policies: Evenly weighted distribution. The default setting. Linked IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned to them. Lowest Latency. Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest latency. Static Configuration via the enrollment list: specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list takes priority over the service-level allocation policy. Custom (Use Azure Function): A custom allocation policy using custom code in an Azure function. An enrollment is the record of devices that may register through autoprovisioning. Two types of enrollments are supported: Group enrollment: Recommended for a large number of devices that share a desired initial configuration, or for devices all going to the same tenant. Individual enrollment: Recommended for devices that require unique initial configurations, or for devices that can only authenticate using SAS tokens via TPM attestation. Enrollment record contains information about the device or group of devices: The attestation mechanism used by the device. The optional intial desired configuration. Desired IoT hub. The desired device ID. A registration is the record of a device successfully registering/provisioning to an IoT Hub via the Device Provisioning Service. Registration records are created automatically; they can be deleted, but they cannot be updated. Operations are the billing unit of the Device Provisioning Service. One operation is the successful completion of one instruction to the service. Operations include device registrations and re-registrations; service-side changes such as adding enrollment list entries, and updating enrollment list entries. The manufacturer is responsible for encoding the device identity info, and the Device Provisioning Service registration URL. The ID scope is assigned to a DPS when it is created by the user. It is used to uniquely identify the specific provisioning service the device will register through. The ID scope is generated by the service and is immutable, which guarantees uniquess. The registration ID uniquely identifies a device in the Device Provisioning Service. The registration ID must be unique in the provisioning service ID scope. Each device must have a registration ID. The registration ID is alphanumeric, case insensitive, and may contain special characters including colon, period, underscore, and hyphen. When TPM attestation is used, the registration ID is provided by the TPM itself. When X.509-based attestation is used, the registration ID is provided by the subject name of the certificate. The device ID is the ID as it appears in IoT Hub. The desired ID may be set in the enrollment entry. Setting the desired ID is only supported in individual enrollments. If no desired device ID is specified in the enrollment list, the registration ID is used as the device ID when registering the device. An attestation mechanism is a method used for confirming a device’s identity. IoT Hub uses \"authentication scheme\" for a similar concept in that service. The DPS supports the following forms of attestation: X.509 certificates based on the standard X.509 certificate authentication flow. Trusted Platform Module (TPM) based on a nonce challenge, using the TPM standard for keys to present a signed Shared Access Signature (SAS) token. TPM attestation does not require a physical TPM on the device, but the service expects to attest using the endorsement key per the TPM spec. Symmetric Key based on shared access signature (SAS) security tokens, which include a hashed signature and an embedded expiration. A hardware Security Module (HSM) is recommended for secure, hardware-based storage of device secrets, and is the most secure form of secret storage. Both X.509 certificates and SAS tokens can be stored in HSM. It is an entry for a single device that may register. Individual enrollments may use X.509 certificates or SAS tokens as attestation mechanisms. Individual enrollments may have the desired IoT hub device ID specified. Individual enrollments are recommended for devices with unique initial configurations, or for devices that can only use SAS tokens via TPM or virtual TPM as the attestation mechanism. An enrollment group is a group of devices that share a specific attestation mechanism. Enrollment groups support both X.509 and symmetric keys. All devices in the X.509 enrollment group present X.509 certificates that have been signed by the same root or intermediate Certificate Authority(CA). Each device in the symmetric key enrollment group present SAS tokens derived from the group symmetric key. The enrollment group name and certificate name must be alphanumeric, lowercase, and may contain hyphens. X.509 certificates are typically arranged in a certificate chain of trust in which each certificate in the chain is signed by the private key of the next higher certificate, and so on, terminating in a self-signed root certificate. This arrangement establishes a delegated chain of trust from the root certificate generated by a trusted root certificate authority (CA) down through each intermediate CA to the end-entity \"leaf\" certificate installed on the device. Often the certificate chain represents some logical or physical heirarchy associated with devices. For example, a manufacturer may: Issue a self-signed root CA certificate. Use the root certificate to generate a unique intermediate CA certificate for each factory. Use each factory’s certificate to generate a unique intermediate CA certificate for each production line in the plant. And finally, use the production line certificate to generate a unique device (end-entity) certificate for each device manufactured on the line. A root certificate is a self-signed X.509 certificate representing a certificate authority (CA). It is the terminus, or trust anchor, of the certificate chain. Root certificates can be self-issued by an organization or purchased from a root certificate authority. The root certificate can also be referred to as a root CA certificate. An intermediate certificate is an X.509 certificate, which has been signed by the root certificate (or by another intermediate certificate with the root certificate in its chain). The last intermediate certificate in a chain is used to sign the leaf certificate. The leaf certificate, or end-entity certificate, identifies the certificate holder. It has the root certificate in its certificate chain and zero or more intermediate certificates. The leaf certificate is not used to to sign any other certificates. It uniquely identifies the device to the provisioning service and is sometimes referred to as the device certificate. During authentication, the device uses the private key associated with its certificate to respond to a proof of possession challenge from the service. Leaf certificates used with an Individual enrollment entry have a requirement that the Subject Name must be set to the registration ID of the Individual Enrollment entry. Leaf certificates used with an Enrollment group entry should have the Subject Name set to the desired device ID, which will be shown in the Registration Records for the authenticated device in the enrollment group. The provisioning service exposes two types of enrollment entry that you can use to control access for devices that use the X.509 attestation mechanism: Individual enrollment entries are configured with the device certificate associated with a specific device. These entries control enrollments for specific devices. Enrollment group entries are associated with a specific intermediate or root CA certificate. These entries control enrollments for all devices that have that intermediate or root certificate in their certificate chain. When a device connects to a provisioning service, if an individual enrollment for the device exists, the provisioning service applies that entry. If there is no individual enrollment for the device and an enrollment group for the first intermediate certificate in the device’s certificate chain exists, the service applies that entry, and so on, up the chain to the root. The service applies the first applicable entry such that: If the first enrollment entry found is enabled, the service provisions the device. If the first enrollment entry found is disabled, the service does not provision the device. If no enrollment entry is found for any of the certificates in the device’s certificate chain, the service does not provision the device. This mechanism and the hierarchical structure of certificate chains provides powerful flexibility in how you can control access for both individual devices and groups of devices. For example, imagine five devices with the following certificate: Device 1: root certificate → certificate A → device 1 certificate Device 2: root certificate → certificate A → device 2 certificate Device 3: root certificate → certificate A → device 3 certificate Device 4: root certificate → certificate B → device 4 certificate Device 5: root certificate → certificate B → device 5 certificate Initially, you can create a single enabled group enrollment entry for the root certificate to enable access for all five devices. If certificate B later becomes compromised, you can create a disabled enrollment group entry for certificate B to prevent Device 4 and Device 5 from enrolling. If still later Device 3 becomes compromised, you can create a disabled individual enrollment entry for its certificate. This revokes access for Device 3, but still allows Device 1 and Device 2 to enroll. The hardware security module, or HSM, is used for secure, hardware based storage of device secrets, and is the most secure form of secret storage. Both X.509 certificates and SAS tokens can be stored in the HSM. TPM refers to a standard for securely storing keys used to authenticate the platform. TPM can also refer to the I/O interface used to interact with the modules implementing the standard. TPMs can exist as discrete hardware, integrated hardware, firmware-based, or software-based. Device Provisioning service only supports TPM 2.0. TPM attestation is based on a nonce challenge, which uses the endorsement and storage root keys to present a signed Shared Access Signature (SAS) token. The endorsement key is an asymmetric key contained inside the TPM. It is internally generated or injected at manufacture time. It is unique for every TPM. It cannot be changed or removed. The private key portion of the endorsement key is never released outside of the TPM. The public portion of the endorsement key is used to recognize a genuine TPM. The storage root key is stored in the TPM. It is used to protect the TPM keys created by applications. These cannot be used without the TPM. The storage root key is generated when you take ownership of the TPM. When you clear the TPM so a new user can take ownership, a new storage root key is generated. TPM attestation uses endorsement key (EK) as the secure root of trust. The EK is unique to the TPM. Changing the EK changes the device into a new one. TPMs have another type of key called the storage root key (SRK). An SRK may be generated by the TPMs owner after taking ownership. Taking ownership is a way of saying \"Someone sets a password on the HSM\". If a TPM device is sold to a new owner, the new owner can take ownership of the TPM to generate a new SRK. The SRK provides a sandbox for the owner to store their keys and provide access revocability if the device or TPM is sold. Once a device has been setup, it will have both an SRK and an EK available for use. TPM ownership could mean many things, follow the instructions relevant to your system to take ownership. Figure 11. Source Microsoft Learn The public part of the EK is used by the DPS for device enrollment. The device vendor can read the EK_pub and upload it to the provisioning service. The device will be recognized when it connects to the DPS. The DPS does not check the SRK or owner. Clearing the TPM erases customer data and not the EK. The device will still be recognized by the DPS when it connects to provision. The device connects to the DPS and requests to provision. It provides the service its registration ID, an ID scope, and the EK_pub and SRK_pub from the TPM. The service passes the encrypted nonce back to the device. The device decrypts the encrypted nonce and uses that to sign a SAS token to connect again and finish provisioning. Figure 12. Source Microsoft Learn The device takes the nonce and uses the private portion of the EK and SRK to decrypt the nonce into the TPM. The order of nonce encryption delegates trust from the EK, which is immutable, to the SRK, which can change if a new owner takes ownership of the TPM. Figure 13. Source Microsoft Learn The device then signs a SAS token using the decrypted nonce. It reestablishes connection to the DPS using the signed SAS token. With the Nonce challenge completed, the service allows the device to provision. Figure 14. Source Microsoft Learn Symmetric key attestation is a simple approach to authenticating a device with DPS. Can be used if you do not have strict security requirements. It is useful for legacy devices with limited security functionality. The DPS creates new symmetric keys with a default length of 32 bytes when new enrollments are saved with the Auto generate keys option enabled. You can also specify your own symmetric keys. Your keys must have a key length between 16 bytes and 64 bytes. The keys must be in valid Base64 format. SAS tokens have the following form:- SharedAccessSignature sig={signature}&se={expiry}&skn={policyName}&sr={URL-encoded-resourceURI} Signature is the HMAC-SHA256 signature string produced by using the symmetric key or the enrollment group key. The key must be decoded from base64 before being used to perform the sha256 computation. The signature result must be url encoded. resourceURI is the uri registration endpoint that can be accessed by this token. It starts with the scope ID for the DPS. for example, {scope ID}/registrations/{registration ID} expiry is the number of seconds since Jan 1970 url-encoded-resourceURI is the lower case URL-encoding of the lower case resource URI. policyName is the name of the shared access policy to which this token refers. The policy name used when provisioning with symmetric key attestation is registration. The DPS automates many of the manual steps that are traditionally involved in provisioning devices. Figure 15. Source Microsoft Learn Device manufacturer adds the device registration information to the enrollment list in the Azure portal. Device contacts the DPS set/embedded at the factory. The device passes identifying information to the DPS to prove its identity. The DPS validates the identity of the device by validating the registration ID and key against the enrollment list entry using either a nonce challenge (TPM) or X.509 certificates. The DPS registers the device with an IoT Hub and populates the device’s twin state. The IoT hub returns the deviceID information to the provisioning service. The DPS returns the IoT hub connection information to the device. The device can now start sending data directly to the IoT hub. The device connects to IoT hub. The device gets the desired state from its device twin in IoT hub. Figure 16. Source Microsoft Learn Encode identity and registration URL - the manufacturer is responsible for encoding the device identity info, and the DPS registration URL Provide device identity - the manufacturer is responsible for communicating it to the operator or directly enrolling it to the DPS. Configure autoprovisioning - a one-time configuration of the Azure IoT Hub and IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service instances, establishing them and creating linkage between them. Enroll device identity - Identity is based on the attestation mechanism the device is designed to use, which allows the provisioning service to attest to the device’s authenticity during registration Build/Deploy registration software. - The Developer is responsible for building and deploying the registration software to the device, using the appropriate SDK. Bootup and register. - Initiated upon boot up by registration software, which is built using a Device Provisioning Service client SDK appropriate for the device and attestation mechanism. Upon successful registration, the device is provided with its IoT Hub unique device ID and connection information, allowing it to pull its initial configuration and begin the telemetry process. Latency As a device moves between locations, network latency can be improved by having the device migrated closed to the IoT hub. Multi-tenancy A device may be reassigned to a new customer within an IoT solution. This new customer may use a different IoT hub. Solution change A device could be moved into a new or updated IoT solution. This may require an IoT hub change. Quarantine A device that is malfunctioning, compromised, or out-of-date may be reassigned to an IoT hub that can only update and get back in compliance. Once the device is functioning properly, it’s then migrated back to its main hub. Device state data is composed of the device twin and device capabilities. This data is stored in the Device Provisioning Service instance and the IoT hub that a device is assigned to When a device is initially provisioned with a DPS instance, the following steps are done: The device sends a provisioning request to a DPS instance. The service instance authenticates the device identity based on an enrollment entry. It then creates the initial configuration of the device state data. The service instance assigns the device to an IoT hub based on the enrollment configuration. It then returns that IoT hub assignment to the device. The provisioning service instance gives a copy of any intial device state data to the assigned IoT hub. The device connects to the assigned IoT hub and begins operations. Over time, the device state data on the IoT hub may be updated by device operations and back-end operations. The initial device state information stored in the DPS instance stays untouched. This untouched device state data is the initial configuration. As a device moves between IoT hubs, it may also be necessary to migrate device state updated on the previous IoT hub over to the new IoT hub. This migration is supported by reprovisioning policies in the DPS. A device usually supports a method to manually trigger provisioning on demand. The reprovisioning policy on an enrollment entry determines how the DPS handles provisioning requests. The policy also determines whether device state data should be migrated during reprovisioning. The same policies are available for individual enrollments and enrollment groups: Reprovision and migrate data: This policy is the default for new enrollment entries. This policy takes action when devices associated with the enrollment entry submint a new request (1). The updated device state information from that initial IoT hub will be migrated over to the new IoT hub (2). During migration, the device’s status will be reported as Assigning. Reprovision and reset to initial config: This policy takes action when devices associated with the enrollment entry submit a new provisioning request (1). The initial configuration data that the provisioning service instance received when the device was provisioned is provided to the new IoT hub (2). During migration, the device’s status will be reported as Assigning. This policy is often used for a factory reset without changing IoT hubs. Never reprovision: The device is never reassigned to a different hub. This policy is provided for managing backwards compatibility.

Clone the Github repository: git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git. Navigate to the TPM simulator folder under azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-tool/tpm-simulator/. Run Simulator.exe prior to running any client application for provisioning device. Let the simulator run in the background throughout the provisioning process to obtain registration ID and Endorsement Key. Both values are only valid for one instance of the run. For production environment, purchase an X.509 CA certificate from a public root certificate authority. For testing environment, you can generate an X.509 root certificate or X.509 certificate chain using: OpenSSL: You can use scripts for certificate generation: Node.js Powershell or Bash Device Identity Composition Engine (DICE) Enulator: DICE can be used for cryptographic device identity and attestation based on TLS protocol and X.509 client certificates. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/tutorial-x509-openssl The DPS uses permissions to grant access to each endpoint. Permissions limit the access to a service instance based on functionality. For example, a backend app must include a token that contains security credentials along with every message it sends to the service. You can grant permissions in the following ways: Shared access authorization policies. Shared access policies can grant any combination of permissions. A newly created provisioning service has the provisioningserviceowner policy set as the default policy. It is a policy with all permissions. DPS grants access to endpoints by verifying a token against the shared access policies. Security credentials, such as symmetric keys, are never sent over the wire. The DPS uses security tokens to authenticate services to avoid sending keys on the wire. Security tokens are limited in time validity and scope. DPS SDKs automatically generate tokens without requiring any special configuration. Use security tokens to grant time-bounded access for services to specific functionality in IoT Device Provisioning Service. To get authorization to connect to the provisioning service, services must send security tokens signed with either a shared access or symmetric key. A token signed with a shared access key grants access to all the functionality associated with the shared access policy permissions. The security token has the following format: SharedAccessSignature sig={signature}&se={expiry}&skn={policyName}&sr={URL-encoded-resourceURI} Service components can only generate security tokens using shared access policies granting the appropriate permissions. Endpoint Functionality {your-service}.azure-devices-provisioning.net/enrollments Provides device enrollment operations with the Device Provisioning Service. {your-service}.azure-devices-provisioning.net/enrollmentGroups Provides operations for managing device enrollment groups. {your-service}.azure-devices-provisioning.net/registrations/{id} Provides operations for retrieving and managing the status of device registrations. As an example, a service generated using a pre-created shared access policy named enrollmentread would create a token with the following parameters: resource URI: {mydps}.azure-devices-provisioning.net, signing key: one of the keys of the enrollmentread policy, policy name: enrollmentread, an expiration time The result, which would grant access to read all enrollment records, would be: SharedAccessSignature sr=mydps.azure-devices- provisioning.net&sig=JdyscqTpXdEJs49elIUCcohw2DlFDR3zfH5KqGJo4r4%3D&se=1456973447&skn=enrollmentread Permission Notes ServiceConfig Grants access to change the service configurations. This permissions is used by backend cloud services. EnrollmentRead Grants read access to the device enrollments and enrollment groups. This permission is used by backend cloud services. EnrollmentWrite Grants write access to the device enrollments and enrollment groups. This permission is used by backend cloud services. RegistrationStatusRead Grants read access to the device registration status. This permission is used by backend cloud services. RegistrationStatusWrite Grants delete access to the device registration status. This permission is used by backend cloud services. A verified X.509 Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is a CA certificate that has been uploaded and registered to your provisioning service and has gone through proof-of-possession with the service. Get a unique verification code generated by the provisioning service for your X.509 CA certificate. You can do this from the Azure portal. Create an X.509 verification certificate with the verification code as its subject and sign the certificate with the private key associated with your X.509 certificate. Upload the signed verification certificate to the service. The service validates the verification certificate using the public portion of the CA certificate to be verified, thus proving that you are in possession of the CA certificate’s private key. Verifying certificate ownership ensures the uploader of the certificate is in possession of the certificate’s private key. Verification prevents a malicious actor sniffing your traffic from extracting an intermediate certificate and using that certificate to create an enrollment group in their own provisioning service, effectively hijacking your devices. By proving ownership of the root or an intermediate certificate in a certificate chain, you are proving that you have permission to generate leaf certificates for the devices that will be registering as part of that enrollment group. For this reason, the root or intermediate certificate configured in an enrollment group must either be a verified certificate or must roll up to a verified certificate in the certificate chain a device presents when it authenticates with the service. In the Azure portal, navigate to your provisioning service and open Certificates from the left-hand menu. Select Add to add a new certificate. Enter a friendly display name for your certificate. Browse to your .cer or .pem file that represents the public part of your X.509 certificate. Select Upload. Once you get a notification that your certificate is successfully uploaded, Select Save. Select the certificate that you added in the previous step. In Certificate Details, select Generate Verification code. The provisioning service creates a verification code that you can use to validate the certificate ownership. Copy the code to your clipboard. You need to sign the Verification Code with the private key associated with your X.509 CA certificate, which generates a signature. This process is known as Proof of possession and results in a signed verification certificate. The Azure IoT Hub C SDK provides Powershell (Windows) and Bash (Linux) scripts to help you create CA and leaf certificates for development and to perform proof-of-possession using a verification code. You download the files relevant to your system to a working folder and follow the instructions in the Managing CA certificates readme to perform proof-of-possession on a CA certificate. The Azure IoT Hub C# SDK contains the Group Certificate Verification Sample, which you can use to do proof-of-possession. The Powershell and Bash scripts provided in the documentation and SDKs rely on OpenSSL. You may also use OpenSSL or other third-party tools to help you do proof-of-possession. Upload the resulting signature as a verification certificate to your provisioning service in the portal. In Certificate Details on the Azure portal, use the File Explorer icon next to the Verification Certificate .pem or .cer file field to upload the signed verification certificate from your system. Once the certificate is successfully uploaded, select Verify. The STATUS of your certificate changes to Verified in the Certificate Explorer list. Select Refresh if it does not update automatically. During the lifecycle of your IoT solution, you will need to roll certificates. It could be because of a security breach or certificate expirations. Rolling device certificates will involve updating the certificate stored on the device and the IoT hub. The device can then reprovision itself with the IoT hub using normal autoprovisioning with the DPS. Certificates on a device should always be stored in a safe place like a HSM. If you are managing your own device certificates, make sure both old and new leaf certificates have the same Common Name (CN). By having the same CN, the device can reprovision itself without creating a duplicate registration record. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/how-to-roll-certificates Deprovisioning a device involves two steps: * Disenroll the device from your provisioning service, to prevent future autoprovisioning. To learn how to disenroll a device, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/how-to-revoke-device-access-portal To learn how to disenroll a device programmatically using one of the provisioning SDKs, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-enroll-device-x509?pivots=programming-language-csharp ** Deregister the device from your IoT Hub, to prevent future communications and data transfer. The exact steps you take to deprovision a device depends on its attestation mechanism and its applicable enrollment entry with your provisioning service. Deprovisioning enrollment groups requires you to consider two scenarios: To deprovision all of the devices that have been provisioned through an enrollment group: Disable the enrollment group to blocklist its signing certificate. Use the list of provisioned devices for that enrollment group to disable or delete each device from the identity registry of its respective IoT hub After disabling or deleting all devices from their respective IoT hubs, you can optionally delete the enrollment group. Be aware, though, that, if you delete the enrollment group and there is an enabled enrollment group for a signing certificate higher up in the certificate chain of one or more of the devices, those devices can re-enroll. To deprovision a single device from an enrollment group: Create a disabled individual enrollment for its leaf (device) certificate. This revokes access to the provisioning service for that device while still permitting access for other devices that have the enrollment group’s signing certificate in their chain. Do not delete the disabled individual enrollment for the device. Doing so will allow the device to re-enroll through the enrollment group. Use the list of provisioned devices for that enrollment group to find the IoT hub that the device was provisioned to and disable or delete it from theat hub’s identity registry.","title":"Azure
