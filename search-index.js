my name is Trelston Moraes and welcome to my personal documentation website. It is more like a personal knowledge management website. At this point of time, it is still a work in progress with 5 important sections that I have detailed below: I have 15 years of experience in developing and deploying small, medium and large enterprise applications using the dotnet platorm. The aim of this section is for me to answer the question - \"If I were to start a new project today. How will I proceed?\". I would like to answer this question not only with a sample project but also a sample end to end process - from development to deployment - that the team will follow. For this, I am going to use the Microsoft Engineering Playbook. While this playbook, is abstract and conceptual, my intention is to make it more concrete with scenarios and walkthroughs. My idea is that a new developer joining the team will execute these walkthroughs and will therefore understand the process, the architecture and the code of my project. In this section, I intend to go through all the architecture styles documented in Azure Architecture Styles and have a terraform file created for each architecture style for easy deployment to Azure. In this section, you will find all the notes I take while studying a particular topic or blog posts. I randomly study different topics at different times and I want to document what I study and also make it easily searchable. Now, I normally use Obsidian as a personal note taking application and pinboard to bookmark all the blog posts, this is just another layer in that system. This is the product section. These are the free products, I am working on.

This approach is useful for chaining together a series of \"or else\" expressions where the first success \"wins\" and becomes the overall result. If the workflow has the concept of sequential steps, then the overall result is just the value of the last step, and all the previous steps are evaluated only for their side effects. In normal F#, this would be written: do some expression do some other expression final expression In normal F#, each expression (other than the last) evaluates to the unit value. The equivalent approach for computation expression is to treat each expression (other than the last) as a wrapped unit value, and \"pass it into\" the next expression, and so on, until you reach the last expression. module TraceBuilder1 = type TraceBuilder1 () = member this.Bind(x,f) = match x with | None -> printfn \"Binding with None.

And the Zero method should create an empty data structure, if needed. We have looked at different implementations for Combine for option types. - The first one used options as \"success/failure\" indicators, when the first success \"won\". In this case Zero was defined as None - The second one was sequential.

Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type. This wrapper type is used in both Bind and Return, which leads to a key benefit: the output of a Return can be fed to the input of a Bind In other words, because a workflow returns a wrapper type, and because let! consumes a wrapper type, you can put a “child” workflow on the right hand side of a let! expression. let subworkflow0 = myworkflow { return 42 } let subworkflow1 = myworkflow { return 43 } let aWrappedValue = myworkflow { let! unwrappedValue1 = subworkflow1 let! unwrappedValue2 = subworkflow2 return unwrappedValue1 + unwrappedValue2 } let aWrappedValue = myworkflow { let! unwrappedValue1 = myworkflow { let! x = myworkflow { return 1 } return x } let! unwrappedValue2 = myworkflow { let! y = myworkflow { return 2 } return y } return unwrappedValue1 + unwrappedValue2 } Sometimes we have a function that already returns a wrapped value, and we want to return it directly. return is no good for this, because it requires an unwrapped type as input. The solution is a variant on return called return!, which takes a wrapped type as input and returns it. The corresponding method in the “builder” class is called ReturnFrom. Typically the implementation just returns the wrapped type “as is”","title":"Composition of computation expression","component":"studynotes","version":"0.1","name":"ComputationExpressionComposition","url":"/studynotes/0.1/FSharp/ComputationExpressionComposition.html","titles":[]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"Avoiding unnecessary evaluations. We want to use the “return” keyword to return early and stop any more processing being done. return and yield do not generate an early return from a computation expression. The entire computation expression, all the way to the last curly brace, is always evaluated and results in a single value. This is a problem, because you might get unwanted side effects and your code is doing something unnecessary, which might cause performance problems. Use the delay method to do this. Any result from Return or Yield is immediately wrapped in a “delay” function like this, and then you can choose whether to run it or not. module TraceBuilder = type TraceBuilder() = member this.Bind(m, f) = match m with | None -> printfn \"Binding with None.

But what about the logging example in the previous post? There was no wrapper type there. There was a let! that did things behind the scenes, but the input type was the same as the output type. The type was left unchanged. The short answer to this is that you can treat any type as its own “wrapper”. If you have a type such as List, it is in fact not a “real” type at all. List is a real type, and List is a real type. But List on its own is incomplete. One way to think about List is that it is a function, not a type. And like any function it takes a parameter, in this case a “type parameter”. Which is why the concept that .NET developers call “generics” is known as “parametric polymorphism” in computer science terminology. Once we grasp the concept of functions that generate one type from another type (called “type constructors”), we can see that what we really mean by a “wrapper type” is just a type constructor. But if a “wrapper type” is just a function that maps one type to another type, surely a function that maps a type to the same type fits into this category? And indeed it does. The “identity” function for types fits our definition and can be used as a wrapper type for computation expressions. We can define the “identity workflow” as the simplest possible implementation of a workflow builder. type IdentityBuilder() = member this.Bind(x,f) = f x member this.Return(x) = x member this.ReturnFrom(x) = x let identity = new IdentityBuilder() let result = identity { let! x = 1 let! y = 2 return x + y } With this in place, you can see that the logging example discussed earlier is just the identity workflow with some logging added in. A major use of computation expressions is to unwrap and rewrap values that are stored in some sort of wrapper type. You can easily compose computation expressions, because the output of a Return can be fed to the input of a Bind. Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type. Any type with a generic parameter can be used as a wrapper type, even lists. When creating workflows, you should ensure that your implementation conforms to the three sensible rules about wrapping and unwrapping and composition.","title":"Identity Wrapper Types","component":"studynotes","version":"0.1","name":"IdentityWrapperTypes","url":"/studynotes/0.1/FSharp/IdentityWrapperTypes.html","titles":[]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"The let! expression is syntactic sugar for a Bind method.

First the original version, using an explicit workflow: module DivideByExplicit = let divideBy bottom top = if bottom = 0 then None else Some(top/bottom) let divideByWorkflow x y w z = let a = x |> divideBy y match a with | None -> None // give up | Some a' -> // keep going let b = a' |> divideBy w match b with | None -> None // give up | Some b' -> // keep going let c = b' |> divideBy z match c with | None -> None // give up | Some c' -> // keep going //return Some c' Next, using our own version of “bind” (a.k.a. “pipeInto”) module DivideByWithBindFunction = let divideBy bottom top = if bottom = 0 then None else Some(top/bottom) let bind (m,f) = Option.bind f m let return' x = Some x let divideByWorkflow x y w z = bind (x |> divideBy y, fun a -> bind (a |> divideBy w, fun b -> bind (b |> divideBy z, fun c -> return' c ))) Next, using a computation expression: module DivideByWithCompExpr = let divideBy bottom top = if bottom = 0 then None else Some(top/bottom) type MaybeBuilder() = member this.Bind(m, f) = Option.bind f m member this.Return(x) = Some x let maybe = new MaybeBuilder() let divideByWorkflow x y w z = maybe { let! a = x |> divideBy y let! b = a |> divideBy w let! c = b |> divideBy z return c } And finally, using bind as an infix operation: module DivideByWithBindOperator = let divideBy bottom top = if bottom = 0 then None else Some(top/bottom) let (>>=) m f = Option.bind f m let divideByWorkflow x y w z = x |> divideBy y >>= divideBy w >>= divideBy z","title":"Introducing Bind","component":"studynotes","version":"0.1","name":"IntroducingBind","url":"/studynotes/0.1/FSharp/IntroducingBind.html","titles":[]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"The bind function “unwraps” the type, and applies the continuation function to the unwrapped value. The continuation function passed into bind is required to have a certain signature. It takes an unwrapped type, but it produces a wrapped type.

Bind applies the continuation function to each element of the passed in list, and then flattens the resulting list of lists into a one-level list. List.collect is a library function that does exactly that. Return converts from unwrapped to wrapped.

Here is the most explicit way of doing it.

And the top-level flow has been submerged in the error handling logic. Computation expressions to the rescue! We can write one that handles the branching of Success/Error behind the scenes: type DbResultBuilder() = member this.Bind(x,f) = match x with | Error _ -> x | Success y -> printfn \"\\tSuccessful: %s\" y f y member this.Return(x) = Success x let dbResult = new DbResultBuilder(); And with this workflow, we can focus on the big picture and write much cleaner code: let product' = dbResult { let! custId = getCustomerId \"Alice\" let! orderId = getLastOrderForCustomer custId let! productId = getLastProductForOrder orderId printfn \"Product is %s\" productId return productId } printfn \"%A\" product And if there are errors, the workflow traps them nicely and tells us where the error was: let product'' = dbResult { let! custId = getCustomerId \"Alice\" let! orderId = getLastOrderForCustomer \"\" //error let! productId = getLastProductForOrder orderId printfn \"Product is %s\" productId return productId } printfn \"%A\" product Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type.

If I learn something new in git, I intend to put it here. A git repository is one giant graph. At the surface level, a git commit consists of 2 things:- a pointer to the state of your code at some moment in time. zero or more pointers to \"parent\" commits A Git commit is a node in a graph, and each one points to the node that came before them. Figure 1. Source: think-like-a-git.net, Git commits (simplified view) To list all commits in your repository: git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all Figure 2. Source: think-like-a-git.net To list all commits in your repository but with a graph view: git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph Figure 3. Source: think-like-a-git.net If you want to see branch and tag labels, add --decorate: git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color You can setup a git alias to do the same thing: git config --global alias.graph \"log --graph --oneline –decorate=short\" GitX shows the logs as follows:- Figure 4. Source: think-like-a-git.net The very colourful labels are called references. References are pointers to commits. There are three types of references: local branch, remote branch, and tag. A local branch reference is a file that contains a 40-byte identifier of the commit that the reference points to. This file is created at the project’s .git/refs/head directory. Creating a branch in Git just means writing 40 bytes to disk, which is why git branch foo` is so fast. Local branch references are specific to a single local repository. Commands that affect local branch references include commit, merge, rebase, and reset. Remote branch references are also specific to a single repository, but one that’s previously been defined as a remote. Commands that affect remote branch references include fetch and push. Tag references are branch references that never move. Once you’ve created a tag, it will never change This behavior makes them useful for marking specific versions of a software package, or marking exactly what got deployed to a production server on a particular date. Only one command affects the tag and i.e git tag Now look at the display:- Figure 5. Source: think-like-a-git.net However, you don’t see commits here. Every git tool hides commits. Imagine this scenario: you write some code and check it in. Then, you realize you forgot to run the tests, so you run them, and they uncover a syntax error. Or you spot a typo. For whatever reason, you weren’t done when you thought you were done. Git gives you an option to tack the new change on to the previous commit using: git commit --amend. This keeps all your related changes bundled together in one commit. A git commit is a SHA-1 hash of the contents of the commit, and the IDs of its parent commits. Which means that, when you use git commit --amend, you’re actually building a completely different commit, and pointing your local branch reference to it instead. The first commit you made is still there on disk, and you can still get back to it Git will decide that it’s time to run garbage collection. You can trigger this process yourself, using git gc. Starting from every branch and every tag, Git walks back through the graph, building a list of every commit it can reach. Once it’s reached the end of every path, it deletes all the commits it didn’t visit. The Secret Of Git can fit it into these four words: References make commits reachable. References …​ whether they are local branches, remote branches, or tags …​ Make commits …​ which are nodes in a graph …​ Reachable …​ so that you can get back to them, and so that Git will not delete them when it decides it is time for spring cleaning. Because references make commits reachable, creating a branch is a way to \"nail down\" part of the graph that you might want to come back to later. Neither git merge nor git rebase will change your existing commits (remember, a commit’s ID is a hash of its contents *and its history*), you can create a temporary branch any time you want to try something you’re even just a little bit unsure about. Creating a branch before you try a merge or a rebase is like saving your game before you battle the boss. Use this pattern if you are unsure or unclear on exactly what git merge does. Being lazy and since it very well explained here without any fluff. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/testing-out-merges/the-scout-pattern.html Being lazy and since it very well explained here without any fluff. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/testing-out-merges/the-savepoint-pattern.html Being lazy and since it very well explained here without any fluff. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/testing-out-merges/black-belt-merging.html Before you start using rebase in a shared repository, make sure everyone who works on your project is comfortable working with rebase. You might also consider changing everyone’s default pull strategy to \"rebase\" instead of \"merge\" What git cherry-pick does is take a commit from somewhere else, and \"play it back\" wherever you are right now. Because this introduces the same change with a different parent, Git builds a new commit with a different ID. Figure 6. Source: think-like-a-git.net If you were at node H in this graph, and you typed git cherry-pick E, you get a copy of commit E, let’s call it E', that pointed to H as its parent. Figure 7. Source: think-like-a-git.net Or if you typed something like git cherry-pick C D E, you get the following: Figure 8. Source: think-like-a-git.net The important thing to notice here is that Git has copied changes made in one place, and replayed them somewhere else. Again being lazy and since it is very well explained here. https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/rebase-from-the-ground-up/using-git-cherry-pick-to-simulate-git-rebase.html To summarize the previous section, this: git checkout foo git checkout -b newbar git cherry-pick C D E git checkout bar git reset --hard newbar git branch -d newbar is equivalent to this: git rebase foo bar When you do a rebase, you are rewriting history. You are, in effect, saying to Git, \"Hey, you know those things that happened over there on that completely different timeline? I want you to pretend that they happened here instead.\" Here’s how I think of it: in English, we read from left to right. On most charts that show the change in something over time, time is shown on the x-axis of the graph, with time increasing from left to right. When you issue commands to the shell, you can put several of them on one line, and they’ll be executed in order from left to right. So when I use git rebase, I (almost) always give it two arguments: the name of the place I want to start from, and the name of the place I want to end up. Or, to put it another way, I tell rebase the sequence of events I want it to create, from left to right: git rebase first_this then_this There may be a time when you would like to change the origin url of your git repository to point to another url. You can use the following sequence of commands to do that: git remote rename origin upstream (1) git remote add origin https://github.com//simple-feed-reader/ (2) git push -u origin main (3) 1 Rename the existing origin remote to upstream 2 Add a new origin remote pointing to your copy of the repository on GitHub. 3 Publish your local Git repository to the newly created GitHub repository. commit guidelines Make small commits and commit often. Commit complete and well tested code. Don’t mix whitespace changes with functional code changes. Write good commit messages. commit message guidelines Why is it necessary? (Fix a bug, increase performance, add a feature) How does it address the issue? For short and obvious changes, this can be omitted. What effects does this change have? (may include benchmarks, side effects etc) What limitations does the current code have? (not necessary, but helps if you can think about it) commit message considerations Don’t assume that the code is self-evident/self-documenting. Finding it difficult to summarize your commit? Maybe it includes more than one bug fix or logical change. Consider splitting the commits using git add -p It should be possible to review a change request without reading the contents of the bug or task. Don’t assume the reviwer understands the problem. commit message structure Separate subject from body with a blank line Limit the subject line to 50 characters Capitalize the subject line Do not end the subject line with period Use the imperative mood in the subject line (Fix typo in log vs. Fixed typo in log or Misc fixes in log code) Wrap the body at 72 characters Use the body to explain what and why vs. how Reference fixed issues with closing keywords Example 1. commit message sample Add code review recipe for Go Helps teams automate linting and build verification for go projects.

The scope of a field gateway includes the field gateway itself and all devices that are attached to it. Gateways may help with device provisioning, data filtering, batching and aggregation, buffering of data, protocol translation, and event processing rules. NAT devices or firewalls do not qualify as field gateways since they are not explicit connection or session terminals, but rather route (or deny) connections or sessions made through them. Application platform as a service (aPaas) provides a cloud environment to build, manage, and deliver applications to customers. Azure IoT central is a fully managed, end-to-end ready made environment for IoT solution development. It delivers built-in disaster recovery, multitenancy, global availability, and a predictable cost structure. You can tailor Azure hardware and software tools to a specific task or job function. You are responsible for scaling and configuration. The underlying infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is taken care for you. Develop your IoT devices using one of the Azure IoT starter kits or choose a device to use from the Azure Certified for IoT device catalog. SDKs are available for multiple programming languages. IoT Plug and Play can simplify how you create embedded code for your devices. Azure IoT Edge enables offloading parts of your workload from the cloud to the devices. It can reduce latency, reduce the amount of data exchanged with the cloud, and enable offline scenarios. Azure Sphere is a secured, high-level app platform with built-in communication and security features for internet connected devices. It includes a secured microcontroller unit, a custom linux-based operating system, and a cloud based security service which provides continuous, renewable security. IoT hub service enables reliable and secure bidirectional communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud based solution. IoT Hub Device Provision System is a helper service that provides zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning of devices to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention. IoT Central uses Azure Digital Twins to synchronize devices and data in the real world with the digital models that enable users to monitor and manage those connected devices. Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Data Explorer can be used to process, query, analyze, and visualize data. Azure Maps is a collection of geospatial services that use fresh mapping data to provide accurate geographic context to web and mobile applications. IoT devices need to run code to be useful. Device operating system options: Windows 10 IoT enterprise (Managed) Ubuntu Core (Open source) Riot (Open source) QNX (managed) Android Automative (managed) A cloud gateway enables you to manage your IoT devices and brokers the communication with other cloud services. Cloud gateways can provide workloads such as: Authentication and Authorization Message brokering Data storage and filtering Data analytics Functions (discrete code blocks that perform specific tasks) Figure 7. Source Microsoft Learn Data is often time-series data. It is common to split data into \"warm\" and \"cold\" data stores. The warm data holds recent data that needs to be accessed with low latency. You can decide the duration range (for example, the last day, week, or month) Data stored in cold storage is historical data. Figure 8. Source Microsoft Learn Without analytics, data collected from IoT would be too voluminous and unstructured to visualize or gain insights. Analytic services enable architects to build meaningful relationships between sets of data in order to make it easier to manage. Data visualization tools can take input from various data streams and combine them into \"dashboards\" that can be used to tell a story about the data that was collected. Ultimately, getting more out of your data is the goal of IoT. IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. IoT Hub gives you a secure communication channel for your devices to send data per-device authentication enables each device to connect securely to IoT hub and be managed securely by IoT hub. You can control user device access and per-device level connection. IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service automatically provisions devices to the correct IoT Hub when the device first boots up. Multiple authentication types: SAS token-based authentication. Individual X.509 certificate authentication for secure, standards-based authentication. X.509 CA authentication for simple, standards-based enrollment. IoT Hub can scale to millions of devices and can handle millions of events per second. IoT Hub has built-in routing and can setup automatic, rules-based message fan-out: Use message routing to control where your hub sends device telemetry. Can route messages to multiple endpoints at no extra cost. No-code routing rules instead of writing custom message dispatcher code. IoT Hub can integrate with other services:- Azure Event Grid to help your business to quickly react to critical events. Azure Logic Apps to automate business processes. Azure Machine Learning to add machine learning and AI models. Azure Stream Analytics to run real-time analytic computations on the data. IoT Hub can manage your devices:- Store, synchronize, and query device metadata and state information for all your devices. Set device state either per-device or based on some common characteristic. Automatically respond to a device-reported state change. Use Azure IoT device SDK libraries to build applications that run on your devices and interact with IoT Hub. There is a limit of 50 IoT hubs per subscription. You can request quota increases by contacting support. Provisioning is a two part process: The first part is establishing the initial connection between the device and the IoT solution by registering the device. The second part is applying the proper configuration to the device based on the requirements of the solution it was registered to. Features:- Secure attestation support for both X.509 and TPM-based identities Multiple allocation policies to control how the DPS assigns devices to IoT hubs. Monitoring and diagnostic logging Mult-hub support allows DPS to assign devices to more than one IoT hub across subscriptions. Cross-region support to assign devices in other regions. When to use:- Zero-touch provisioning to an IoT solution without hardcoding IoT Hub connection. Load-balancing devices across multiple hubs. Connecting devices to a particular IoT solution depending on use case. Connecting a device to the IoT hub with the lowest latency. Reprovisioning based on a change in the device. Rolling the keys used by the device to connect to IoT Hub. To evaluate which IoT Hub tier is right for you solution, consider the following two questions: What features do I plan to use? How much data do I plan to move daily? The basic tier enables a subset of features and is intended for IoT solutions that only need uni-directional communication from devices to the cloud. If your IoT solution is based around collecting data from devices and analyzing it centrally, then the basic tier is probably right for you. The standard tier of IoT Hubs enables all features, and is required for any IoT solutions that want to make use of the bi-directional communication capabilities. If you would like to control IoT devices remotely or distribute some of your workloads onto the devices themselves, then you should consider the standard tier. Message traffic is measured for your IoT hub on a per-unit basis. When you create an IoT hub, you choose its tier and edition, and set the number of units available. You can purchase up to 200 units for the B1, B2, S1, or S2 edition, or up to 10 units for the B3 or S3 edition. Tier edition Sustained throughput Sustained send rate B1, S1 Up to 1111 KB/minute per unit (1.5 GB/day/unit) Average of 278 messages/minute per unit (400,000 messages/day per unit) B2, S2 Up to 16 MB/minute per unit (22.8 GB/day/unit) Average of 4,167 messages/minute per unit (6 million messages/day per unit) B3, S3 Up to 814 MB/minute per unit (1144.4 GB/day/unit) Average of 208,333 messages/minute per unit (300 million messages/day per unit) Partions can be used to reduce contentions that could occur when concurrently reading and writing to event streams. The partition limit is chosen when IoT hub is created. The maximum partition limit is 32 but most IoT hubs only need 4 partitions. The number of partitions is directly related to the number of concurrent readers you expect to have. The default value of four partitions should be used unless specified by the architect. You can upgrade from the basic tier to the standard tier without interrupting your existing operations. You cannot downgrade to a lower tier. You can move from S2 to S1 but not from S1 to B1 tier. An endpoint is a service that can retrieve data from other services. Examples of endpoint types: Device-facing endpoints that enables devices to perform operations such as sending device-to-cloud messages and receiving cloud-to-device messages. Service-facing management endpoints that enable back-end apps to perform operations such as device identity management and device twin management. Service facing built-in endpoints for reading device-to-cloud messages. Custom endpoints to receive device-to-cloud messages dispatched by a routing rule. Figure 9. Source Microsoft Learn The IoT hub endpoints: Resource provider. It exposes an Azure Resource Manager interface. This interface enables Azure subscription owners to create and delete IoT hubs, and to update IoT hub properties. Device identity management. A set of HTTPS REST endpoints to manage device identities. Device identities are used for device authentication and access control. Device twin management. A set of HTTPS REST endpoints to query and update device twins. Jobs management HTTS REST endpoint to query and manage jobs. Device endpoints. For each device, a set of endpoints are exposed Send device-to-cloud messages Receive cloud-to-device messages Initiate file uploads - a device uses this endpoint to receive an Azure storage SAS URI from IoT Hub to upload a file. Retrieve and update device twin properties. Receive direct method requests. Service endpoints. Exposes a set of endpoints for your solution back end to communicate with your devices. With one exception, these endpoints are only exposed using the AMQP protocols. The method invocation endpoint is exposed over the HTTPS protocol. Receive device-to-cloud messages. Send cloud-to-device messages and receive delivery acknowledgements. Receive file notifications. Direct method invocation. Receive operation monitoring events. These endpoints act as service endpoints and are used as sinks for message routes. Devices cannot write directly to these custom endpoints. The following services are supported as custom endpoints. Azure Storage containers Event Hubs Service Bus Queues Service Bus Topics There are three different ways for controlling access to IoT Hub: Azure AD. It provides identity-based authentication and fine-grained authorization with Azure RBAC. It supports only IoT hub service api’s. SAS. It lets you group permissions and grant them to applications using access keys and signed security tokens. Per-device security credentials. Each IoT Hub contains an identity registry. For each device in this registry, you can configure security credentials that grant DeviceConnect permissions scoped to the device’s endpoints. Use shared access policies for IoT hub-level access. Use the individual device credentials to scope access to that device only. Azure IoT hub grants access to endpoints by verifying a token against the shared access policies and identity registry security credentials. IoT Hub uses security tokens to authenticate devices and services to avoid sending keys on the wire. Security tokens are limited in time validity and scope. Some scenarios do require you to use security tokens directly. Example: The direct use of the MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS surfaces. The implementation of the token service pattern. IoT hub also allows devices to authenticate with IoT Hub using X.509 certificates. You can verify using X.509 certificates by uploading either a certificate thumbprint or a certificate authority(CA) to Azure IoT Hub. Authentication using certificate thumbprints only verifies that the presented thumbprint matches the configured thumbprint. Authentication using certificate authority validates the certificate chain. Supported Certificates include: An existing X.509 certificate. A device may already have a certificate that it can then use to authenticate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication. CA-signed X.509 certificate. You can use a Certificate Authority signed certificate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication. A self generated and self-signed X.509 certificate. A device manufacturer or in-house deployer can generate these certificates and store the corresponding private key (and certificate) on the device. You can use tools such as OpenSSL and Windows SelfSignedCertificate utility for this purpose. Only works with thumbprint authentication. A device may either use an X.509 certificate or a security token for authentication, but not both.","title":"Azure
